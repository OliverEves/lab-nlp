In simple words, it's to understand whether a person is happy or unhappy in producing the piece of text. Why we (or rather, companies) care about sentiment in texts? It's because by understanding the sentiments in texts, we will be able to know if our customers are happy or unhappy about our products and services. If they are unhappy, the subsequent action is to figure out what have caused the unhappiness and make improvements.\n","\n","Basic sentiment analysis only understands the *positive* or *negative* (sometimes *neutral* too) polarities of the sentiment. More advanced sentiment analysis will also consider dimensions such as agreement, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and so on. In this challenge we will conduct the basic positive vs negative sentiment analysis based on real Twitter tweets.\n","\n","NLTK comes with a [sentiment analysis package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html). This package is great for dummies to perform sentiment analysis because it requires only the textual data to make predictions. For example:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n",">>> txt = \"Ironhack is a Global Tech School ranked num 2 worldwide. \n","\n","Our mission is to help people transform their careers and join a thriving community of tech professionals that love what they do.\"\n",">>> analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n",">>> analyzer.polarity_scores(txt)\n","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.8442}\n","```\n","\n","In this challenge, however, you will not use NLTK's sentiment analysis package because in your Machine Learning training in the past 2 weeks you have learned how to make predictions more accurate than that. The [tweets data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) we will be using today are already coded for the positive/negative sentiment. You will be able to use the Naïve Bayes classifier you learned in the lesson to predict the sentiment of tweets based on the labels."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sJbnHNWAg5Co"},"source":["## Conducting Sentiment Analysis\n","\n","### Loading and Exploring Data\n","\n","The dataset we'll be using today is located on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). Once you have downloaded and imported the dataset, it you will need to define the columns names: df.columns = ['target','id','date','flag','user','text']\n","\n","*Notes:* \n","\n","* The dataset is huuuuge (1.6m tweets). When you develop your data analysis codes, you can sample a subset of the data (e.g. 20k records) so that you will save a lot of time when you test your codes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"BLMCttgNg5Cp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669388103480,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":600,"user":{"displayName":"Oliver Eves","userId":"00202762475525795258"}},"outputId":"5923f8a7-fdf9-4b2d-af3e-fca994d791bf"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package omw-1.4 to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package omw-1.4 is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package averaged_perceptron_tagger to\n","[nltk_data]     /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping taggers/averaged_perceptron_tagger.zip.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}],"source":["# your code here\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import re\n","import ssl\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.corpus import wordnet\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer \n","nltk.download('omw-1.4')\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import nltk\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","nltk.download('tagsets')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"B2pPlX0GQLQw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669388112560,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Oliver Eves","userId":"00202762475525795258"}},"outputId":"9007655a-e350-4b60-827d-95cb1dc3c3bb"},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package tagsets to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package tagsets is already up-to-date!\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9XVjoWlQIn0T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669388117204,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1771,"user":{"displayName":"Oliver Eves","userId":"00202762475525795258"}},"outputId":"cda45f9b-7323-4bfe-f84d-af9db7a405ad"},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/your-code/training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv', encoding='latin-1')\n","data.columns = ['target','id','date','flag','user','text']\n","data.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":337},"id":"HC3RHTk4JDTm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669388123836,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":5392,"user":{"displayName":"Oliver Eves","userId":"00202762475525795258"}},"outputId":"1e60cab7-087e-4bb5-b55e-7c20cda529ab"},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   target          id                          date      flag           user  \\\n","0       0  1467810672  Mon Apr 06 22:19:49 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY  scotthamilton   \n","1       0  1467810917  Mon Apr 06 22:19:53 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY       mattycus   \n","2       0  1467811184  Mon Apr 06 22:19:57 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY        ElleCTF   \n","3       0  1467811193  Mon Apr 06 22:19:57 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY         Karoli   \n","4       0  1467811372  Mon Apr 06 22:20:00 PDT 2009  NO_QUERY       joy_wolf   \n","\n","                                                text  \n","0  is upset that he can't update his Facebook by ...  \n","1  @Kenichan I dived many times for the ball.

The bag of words contains all the unique words in your whole text body (a.k.a. *corpus*) with the number of occurrence of each word. It will allow you to understand which words are the most important features across the whole corpus.\n","\n","Also, you can imagine you will have a massive set of words. The less important words (i.e. those of very low number of occurrence) do not contribute much to the sentiment. Therefore, you only need to use the most important words to build your feature set in the next step. In our case, we will use the top 5,000 words with the highest frequency to build the features.\n","\n","In the cell below, combine all the words in `text_processed` and calculate the frequency distribution of all words. A convenient library to calculate the term frequency distribution is NLTK's `FreqDist` class ([documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#module-nltk.probability)). Then select the top 5,000 words from the frequency distribution."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8chDmXvkg5Cq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669395430727,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":246,"user":{"displayName":"Oliver

Using the top 5,000 words, create a 2-dimensional matrix to record whether each of those words is contained in each document (tweet). Then you also have an output column to indicate whether the sentiment in each tweet is positive. For example, assuming your bag of words has 5 items (`['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']`) out of 4 documents (`['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']`), your feature set is essentially:\n","\n","| Doc | one | two | three | four | five | is_positive |\n","|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n","| A | True | False | False | True | False | True |\n","| B | False | False | False | True | True | False |\n","| C | False | True | False | False | False | True |\n","| D | True | False | False | False | True | False|\n","\n","However, because the `nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train` class we will use in the next step does not work with Pandas dataframe, the structure of your feature set should be converted to the Python list looking like below:\n","\n","```python\n","[\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': True,\n","\t\t'two': False,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': True,\n","\t\t'five': False\n","\t}, True),\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': False,\n","\t\t'two': False,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': True,\n","\t\t'five': True\n","\t}, False),\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': False,\n","\t\t'two': True,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': False,\n","\t\t'five': False\n","\t}, True),\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': True,\n","\t\t'two': False,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': False,\n","\t\t'five': True\n","\t}, False)\n","]\n","```\n","\n","To help you in this step, watch the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vVskDsHcVc) to learn how to build the feature set with Python and NLTK.
